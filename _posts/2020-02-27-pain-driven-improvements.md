As of today, my blog does not have a search feature. I've been blogging daily and so far I've written 90 posts. I can't tell you what all they were and I find myself referring back to them. I read them for myself, to share to other people, or for continuing an idea. 

Today my co-worker texted me: 

"You need a search feature on your blog. I can't find a post."

I can't tell you how many times in the last 3 years I've thought about adding a search feature on my blog. I've researched over and over. Then, I wouldn't get around to implementing it. I might have added it to a backlog and prioritized it. Months later, the idea would come back to my head and I would research it again. Maybe I would take take a bit more action on it. 

I was trying to pre-empt a problem. The day someone couldn't find a post on my blog. The irony is that I did not have many blog posts in my site. I only had about *two pages* of content.

### Pain-driven improvements

Today, my co-worker had a trouble finding a post that he found useful. I've had the same painpoint too. I've been referring to these posts. But, I came up with a simple solution. Google.

`site:gaunacode.com my search terms here`

Using Google operators, I can limit the search to only my blog. 

Now, I have a lot more content and I have a lot more visitors. I can't assume that they know about this feature in Google.
This is causing enough pain that I feel comfortable improving it. It's going to be useful. It will provide value.

<mark>What about in your current processes or infrastructure is truly causing pain? And what are you trying to preempt?</mark>
