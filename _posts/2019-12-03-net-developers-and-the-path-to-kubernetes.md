Many .NET developers working on enterprise applications are feeling stuck doing traditional .NET web development; for example, doing WCF development, maybe some ASP.NET Web Forms, or a mishmash of MVC and other tech. 

The new hype in the development world is not _just_ about a new framework like it has been in the past. In other words, the hype is not just about ASP.NET Core... it's also about a new runtime, containerization, microservices, and Kubernetes. 

It's a whole _range_ of topics. It's inconceivable to think that a .NET developer would pick up all these new technologies at once.

Here's a version of my path with adaptations:

- Learn dependency injection and unit testing
- Learn ASP.NET Core with .NET Core
- Learn a scripting language. Powershell is easiest on a Windows OS.
- Learn Unix basics
- Learn Docker and Containerization .NET Core apps
- Learn Azure DevOps or another form of CI/CD pipelines
- Learn Kubernetes fundamentals and deployments
- Learn how to use an Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tool for telemetry

It a long and fun journey ahead. There's checkpoints you can take in between so that you can still deliver projects without the end result of Kubernetes.
