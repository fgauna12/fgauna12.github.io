Yesterday, I talked about the importance of [psychological-safety](https://gaunacode.com/psychological-safety) and how it helps increase the effectiveness in teams. Also, I provided evidence from a research study done at Google. 

Today, during our second day of our cultural workshop at work, I was reminded of the importance of **courage.** There might be times where it will take a leap of faith to say something first. To challenge the status quo. Give your opinion. Or provide feedback to a colleague. 

Environments are co-created by everyone. Are you speaking up to what's not working in your eyes?\
Don't let fear hold you back.
