My name is Facundo Gauna. Sometimes I go by Frank. 

I'm a Solutions Architect at BoxBoat. I help teams create [cloud-native](https://www.cncf.io/) systems on Azure. I used to be a .NET developer and avid ping pong player. 

## Where's that name from?

Argentina. I was named after a book about the struggle in Argentina about European modernization in the 1830s. Never read it.
