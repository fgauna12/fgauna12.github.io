My name is Facundo Gauna. Sometimes I go by Frank. Married young but loving every minute of it.

I'm a Cloud Solutions Architect at [Nebbia Technology](http://nebbiatech.com) in Orlando, FL. I have a degree in Computer Engineering from University of Central Florida.

You might be able to find me on Slack at [Orlando Devs](http://orlandodevelopers.technology/). 
Email me or shoot me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/facundo-gauna-601b8a47) . 

I enjoy coding quite a bit and I consider it one of my hobbies. I also like to play table tennis and attend Meetups in the Orlando area.
Used to be a recreational gamer but I stopped so I could have time for other things. 

## Where's that name from?

<p>Argentina. I was named after a book about the struggle in Argentina about European modernization in the 1830s. Never read it.

<mark>Fun Fact:</mark> If you like Bacardi, the founder's name is [Facundo Bacardi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facundo_Bacardi).
Ask me how I found out.
