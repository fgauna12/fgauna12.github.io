My name is Facundo Gauna. Sometimes I go by Frank. 

I'm a Cloud Solutions Architect at New Signature. I help companies with various projects centered around Azure, DevOps, and Architecture. Continuous Delivery usually gets companies only so far. Architecture and Cloud are essential to enable DevOps as well. 

## Where's that name from?

Argentina. I was named after a book about the struggle in Argentina about European modernization in the 1830s. Never read it.
