My name is Facundo Gauna ("faa-cun-doh" "gah-oo-nah"). Sometimes I go by Frank, because it starts with F? 

I'm a software developer from sunny Orlando, Fl `:palm_tree`. I got a degree in Computer Engineering from University of Central Florida.

I'm not active on Facebook, Twitter, or Google+ so you can follow me but I won't guarantee anything.
Rarely on Skype either.  `:stuck_out_tongue:`

You might be able to find me on Slack at [Orlando Devs](http://orlandodevelopers.technology/). 
Email me or shoot me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/facundo-gauna-601b8a47) . 

I enjoy coding quite a bit and I consider it one of my hobbies. I also like to play table tennis and attend Meetups in the Orlando area.
Used to be a recreational gamer but I stopped so I could have time for other things. Lastly, I dabble a little bit in investing.

I don't try to remember obscure things so I will use this site for record keeping. If I find something interesting on something new like NoSQL, I'll share as well.
