title: About
---
My name is Facundo Gauna. Sometimes I go by Frank. 

I'm a Cloud Solutions Architect at New Signature. I help companies with various projects centered around Azure, DevOps, and Architecture. Continuous Delivery usually gets companies only so far. Architecture and Cloud are essential to enable DevOps as well. 

Because of the nature of consulting, I see many more failures than successes. Companies usually seek help when things are not going well. 
I am making it my personal mission to help successful projects be the norm. I want to be called in order to help amplify delivery, not save it.

## Where's that name from?

Argentina. I was named after a book about the struggle in Argentina about European modernization in the 1830s. Never read it.
